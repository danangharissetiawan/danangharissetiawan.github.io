Hello! I have been a student in high school who had taken an interest in computer science and was introduced to programming in my freshman year. Since then, I started developing Web and ML projects, and now I'm pursuing my education as a student at [UDINUS](https://dinus.ac.id) in Computer Science and Engineering (2020-2023).

Today, I'm currently in my third semester of college and I'm a scrum developer in charge of some development and testing of microservices code in the Research Social Project.

Here is a list of the technologies that I work with in [Risset Social](https://www.risset.social)!
