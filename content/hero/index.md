I am an Indonesia-based Web Developer and Data Analyst with a purpose-driven creative mindset and a passion for learning and innovation.

Currently studying at [Universitas Dian Nuswantoro](https://dinus.ac.id/) majoring in computer science and currently focusing on web development and data analysis.

Outside work, I occasionally blog on [Medium](https://medium.com/@mr.danangharissetiawan), and on [My Blog](https://memories.risset.me).
Other than that, I have great interests in martial arts, writing, and music, and also likes to drink â˜• [Coffee!](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/darisset) ðŸ¥°
